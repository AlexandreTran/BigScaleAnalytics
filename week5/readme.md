# Data Cleaning

This week we will learn how to use Azure ML visual tools to do data cleaning and pre-processing. Follow the instructions in the pdf.

There is also a nice tutorial [here](https://blog.datasciencedojo.com/azure-ml-tutorial/) which I would recommend to follow, it is made for Azure ML studio which is a different application. Nevertheless it helps as the interface of this application is very similar to Azure ML.
