Welcome to week 1 of Big Scale Analytics course!

In this week we are going to have a brief overview of what cloud based services are. Specifically, we will look into Microsoft Azure, one of the most used cloud services, and get to know many services that Azure provides. Later on, we want you to create an account on MS Azure and register for a student subscription. You will get a 100$ credit for one year with the student subscription.

We are going to use MS Azure throughout the semester, so make sure that you make an account and get the student subscription at the end of this week. Once you make an account, try to explore the different features you see in the Azure portal, which is basically a user interface.

**Highly recommended: We incourage you to check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/ , it is a rich resource to learn how to use different services in MS Azure**
